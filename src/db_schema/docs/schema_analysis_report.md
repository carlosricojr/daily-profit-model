# Database Schema Analysis and Optimization Report
**Prop Trading Daily Profit Model - Production Readiness Assessment**

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the current database schema and presents three optimized versions designed for different operational requirements and risk tolerances. Each version builds upon the previous one, implementing increasingly sophisticated optimizations while maintaining data integrity and system reliability.

### Current Schema Analysis

The baseline schema contains 15 tables with approximately 81 million records in `raw_trades_closed`, representing a typical prop trading data warehouse. Key bottlenecks identified:

1. **Performance Issues**
   - No partitioning on large tables (81M+ records)
   - Missing foreign key constraints
   - Inadequate indexing strategy
   - No materialized views for common aggregations

2. **Scalability Concerns**
   - Single-threaded query execution
   - No horizontal scaling capability
   - Limited concurrent user support
   - Manual maintenance procedures

3. **Operational Gaps**
   - No automated statistics updates
   - Missing data integrity constraints
   - No performance monitoring
   - Limited backup/recovery procedures
