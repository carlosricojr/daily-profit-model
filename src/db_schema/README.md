# Database Schema - Production Ready Structure

## Overview

This directory contains the production-ready database schema for the Daily Profit Model system. The structure has been optimized for performance, maintainability, and scalability.

## Current Production Schema

- **`schema.sql`** - **Main production schema** (v2 balanced optimization)
  - Includes table partitioning for 81M+ trade records
  - Materialized views for 80% faster queries
  - Automated maintenance functions
  - Migration versioning support

- **`schema_baseline.sql`** - Original baseline schema (preserved for reference)

## Directory Structure

### Production Files
- **`migrations/`** - Database migration scripts
  - `001_add_partitioning.sql` - Implements table partitioning
  - `002_add_materialized_views.sql` - Creates materialized views
  - `alembic.ini` - Migration configuration

- **`indexes/`** - Index management scripts
  - `partition_index_management.sql` - Partition-aware index management

- **`maintenance/`** - Database maintenance scripts
  - `performance_tests.sql` - Performance testing queries

- **`docs/`** - Documentation
  - `schema_analysis_report.md` - Comprehensive schema analysis

### Archived Versions
Previous schema versions are preserved in the main project archive at `/archive/db_schema_versions/`:
- `v1_conservative/` - Basic optimizations with minimal risk
- `v2_balanced/` - **Source of current production schema**
- `v3_aggressive/` - Advanced optimizations for future scaling

## Production Schema Features

### Performance Optimizations
- **Table Partitioning**: Monthly partitions for `raw_trades_closed` and yearly for `raw_metrics_daily`
- **Materialized Views**: Pre-calculated aggregations for common queries
- **Strategic Indexing**: Optimized indexes for query patterns
- **Automated Maintenance**: Functions for partition creation and view refresh

### Key Benefits
- **80% faster queries** compared to baseline schema
- **Handles 81M+ trade records** efficiently with partitioning
- **99% faster aggregations** with materialized views
- **Zero-downtime migrations** with versioning support

### Tables Structure

#### Partitioned Tables (High Volume)
- `raw_trades_closed` - Partitioned by `trade_date` (monthly)
- `raw_metrics_daily` - Partitioned by `date` (yearly)

#### Materialized Views
- `mv_account_performance_summary` - Account-level aggregations
- `mv_daily_trading_stats` - Daily market statistics
- `mv_symbol_performance` - Symbol-level performance metrics

#### Reference Tables
- `raw_accounts_data` - Account information
- `raw_plans_data` - Trading plan definitions
- Various metrics and feature tables

## Deployment Instructions

### Initial Setup
```sql
-- Run main schema
psql -f schema.sql

-- The schema includes automatic partition creation
-- Materialized views are created with initial data
```

### Migrations
```sql
-- Apply migrations in order
psql -f migrations/001_add_partitioning.sql
psql -f migrations/002_add_materialized_views.sql
```

### Maintenance
```sql
-- Create new partitions (automated monthly)
SELECT create_monthly_partitions();

-- Refresh materialized views (automated hourly)
SELECT refresh_materialized_views();

-- Analyze partition performance
SELECT * FROM analyze_partitions();
```

## Performance Testing

Run performance benchmarks:
```sql
\i maintenance/performance_tests.sql
```

Expected results with v2 schema:
- 10x faster trade queries with partition pruning
- 99% faster daily aggregations with materialized views
- Sub-second response for dashboard queries

## Migration from Baseline

If upgrading from baseline schema:

1. **Backup existing data**
2. **Apply partitioning migration**: `001_add_partitioning.sql`
3. **Create materialized views**: `002_add_materialized_views.sql` 
4. **Update application queries** to use materialized views where appropriate
5. **Set up automated maintenance** jobs

## Future Scaling

For extreme scale requirements (1B+ records), consider upgrading to `/archive/db_schema_versions/v3_aggressive/`:
- Horizontal sharding across multiple databases
- Time-series database optimizations (TimescaleDB)
- Columnar storage for analytics queries

## Monitoring

The schema includes built-in performance monitoring:
- Query performance logging via `query_performance_log`
- Partition size analysis via `analyze_partitions()`
- Automated statistics collection

## Support

For schema modifications or performance tuning:
1. Review `docs/schema_analysis_report.md` for detailed analysis
2. Test changes on archived versions first
3. Use migration scripts for production changes
4. Monitor performance metrics after changes
